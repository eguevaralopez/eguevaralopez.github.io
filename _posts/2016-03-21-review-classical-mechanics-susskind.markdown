While perusing the science section of a nearby bookstore I came across a nifty little paperback with a nice enough cover to warrant buying it;

I remember watching some of Prof. Susskind's lectures on classical and quantum mechanics when they became available in YouTube, back in 2008. They are advertised as an introduction to high-level physics, but that is a bold claim to make when at the next moment you are reviewing basic calculus. Still, they were lovely refreshers on the subjects at hand.

The mechanics lectures where a fast-paced introduction to the subject. While not in-depth, they had gems like the opening discussion on what constitutes a physical law by using coins and dies as examples. These simple systems were enough to introduce concepts like reversibility, determinism, conservation laws, symmetries, and phase space. Yet another gem was the aside on the resolving power needed to correctly determine the motion of particles or bodies, it was lovely.

All in all, I had a positive experience with these so called *Theoretical Minimum* lectures. I felt that if you watched these on the side while you worked through a serious book, you would end up with a solid understanding of mechanics. Or to put it another way: these videos are meant to spice up your reading of *Landau & Lifshitz*---[the actual origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Theoretical_Physics_School) of the term Theoretical Minimum.

As it turns out, the lectures were laid down in book form; at around 230 pages, its a short, quick read. While the essence of the video lectures is conserved, the subject matter was further distilled to appeal to a broader audience. I think it is much better structured logically---the flow of ideas is nicer, especially in the second half of the book---, but I also think that they slowed it down considerably. The first five lectures deal with structural aspects of classical mechanics and review Newton's formulation, this means there are around 100 pages without mention of the *Least Action Principle*, which in the videos is introduced in lecture 3. The remaining six lectures, seven with the appendix, treat the lagrangian, conservation laws, the hamiltonian, Liouville's theorem, Poisson brackets, the electromagnetic lagrangian, and Kepler's problem. It is this half of the book which I find worthwhile and entertaining.

[There is a site](http://www.madscitech.org/tm/) devoted to the book. In it you can find a somewhat lengthy list of errata and also---amusingly---somewhere in there you can read the following statement;

>Note: This book was written and typeset in Mathematica versions 7, 8, and 9.

I assure you it shows. Contrary to the stunning cover, the insides are pretty ugly. Why anyone would abstain from using $$\mathrm{\LaTeX}$$ to publish a math or physics related book is beyond me at this point.

So, would I recommend this book? Yes and no. I would recommend it to undergrad students, to read during their lagrangian--based mechanics course. I would recommend it to someone who watched Susskind's lectures and didn't take notes, or to someone who wants to relive the lectures without having to binge videos. The good thing about this book is that its a quick, easy read. *However*, if time is not a constraint, I would always recommend the video lectures over the book.

#### extra credit

Based on the [2007 version of these lectures](http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/classical-mechanics/2007/fall) and my own lecture notes from when I watched, here's the correlation between [L]andau & Lifshitz's **Mechanics** and [S]usskind's video lectures, so you can watch on the side as you read the bookâ€¦

- [S] Lectures 1 & 2 $$\rightarrow$$ introduction, watch first;

- [L] Chapters 1 & 2 $$\leftrightarrow$$ [S] Lectures 3 to 5;

- [L] Chapters 3 to 6 $$\rightarrow$$ "examples" of the theory, i.e., develop your understanding of mechanics from these fundamental applications;

- [L] Chapter 7 $$\leftrightarrow$$ [S] Lectures 6, 7, 9. These are helpful in making the material more accessible than *L&L*'s presentation;

- [S] Lecture 8 $$\rightarrow$$ a nice extra on electromagnetism.
