Because a grad student's money is better spent on food and drink, here is a compendium of useful and free books/notes/videos I've gone through (or plan to go through, in some cases) as I work towards a degree in Physics;

- ***The Feynman Lectures on Physics***. Need I say more? Available [from Caltech](http://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/). There are no words to describe just how *good* these lectures are, and its a very big deal that they are available online to everyone. My thesis advisor recommended to buy this set, along with Dirac's ***Principles*** and von Neumann's ***Mathematical Foundations of QM*** with my first Ph.D. salary (if I decide to go for one, that is). 

- Keeping with the lectures by famous physicists, you can find Susskind's ***Theoretical Minimum*** (a term originating from Lev Landau) lecture series [over here](http://theoreticalminimum.com). These are enriching as well, full of little insights. In fact, Susskind forever changed the way I picture and think about *Hamilton's principle* when he drew an *n*-dimensional coordinate system and sketched the action.

- Stone & Goldbart's book on mathematical methods—***Mathematics for Physics: A Guided Tour for Grad Students***—is available as a pre-publication draft [from Goldbart's website](http://www.goldbart.gatech.edu/PG_MS_MfP.htm). I mean, its an *okay* book if you need a resource on math. methods, especially a `pdf` to annotate digitally, if you're into that. My recommendation would be to get a *used* copy of Arfken and Weber[^1] and have it on the bookshelf.

The next two recommendations I'm particularly excited about! Not only are they absurdly *high quality* material, they can be seen as replacements for the *expensive* books they turned into—believe me, I checked!

- Carroll's ***Lecture Notes on General Relativity*** can be found [in the arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9712019). These notes graduated and became Carroll's GR textbook, ***Spacetime and Geometry***. These are written in a style that I found very engaging, its weird to say but I was *addicted* to these lecture notes. Fun fact: I had 2 courses with this book as recommended reference—its good!

- Kardar's MIT course *[8.333 Statistical Mechanics I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-333-statistical-mechanics-i-statistical-mechanics-of-particles-fall-2013/)* is a pleasure to watch, and the lecture notes available there form the backbone of his SM textbook. I found these when I needed them most: the lecturer for my course constantly reverted to dutch and used a book I didn't enjoy much. I was never fond of S.M., but I went on to watch *[8.334 Statistical Mechanics II](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-334-statistical-mechanics-ii-statistical-physics-of-fields-spring-2014/)* which is also available, along with its lecture notes—go crazy!

I'm always on the lookout for quality stuff, so there will probably be other posts like this one in the future.
