Because a grad student's money is better spent on food and drink, here is a compendium of useful and free books/notes/videos I've gone through (or plan to go through, in some cases) as I work towards a degree in Physics;

- *The Feynman Lectures on Physics*. Need I say more? Available [from Caltech](http://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)  for free;
- you can find Susskind's *Theoretical Minimum* (a term originating from Lev Landau) lecture series available for free [over here](http://theoreticalminimum.com).
- Stone & Goldbart's book on mathematical methods—*Mathematics for Physics: A Guided Tour for Grad Students*—is available as a pre-publication draft [from Goldbart's website](http://www.goldbart.gatech.edu/PG_MS_MfP.htm);
- Carroll's *Lecture Notes on General Relativity* can be found for free [in the arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9712019). These notes graduated and became Carroll's own GR textbook, *Spacetime and Geometry*;
- Kardar's MIT course *[8.333 Statistical Mechanics I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-333-statistical-mechanics-i-statistical-mechanics-of-particles-fall-2013/)* is a pleasure to watch, and the lecture notes available there form the backbone of his SM textbook. *[8.334 Statistical Mechanics II](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-334-statistical-mechanics-ii-statistical-physics-of-fields-spring-2014/)* is also available, along with its lecture notes—go crazy!

I'm always on the lookout for free, quality stuff, so there will probably be other posts like this one in the future.
