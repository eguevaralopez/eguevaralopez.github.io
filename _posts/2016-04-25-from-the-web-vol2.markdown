Second round of freebies from the web, with a slight bias for *Quantum Field Theory* as I keep studying the subject;

- I have to mention Tong's [**Lectures on Quantum Field Theory**](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft.html). The videos are terrible quality `wmv` files, don't even bother with those: the real treat are the lecture notes. They are essentially a walkthrough of chapters 1 through 4 of Peskin and Schroeder's **An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory**.

- A resource I consult from time to time—when I need more explaining than P&S/Zee can provide, so not too often—is  Srednicki's [**Quantum Field Theory**](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/qft.html). Its available as a pre-publication draft, it has since been picked up by Cambridge University Press.

- When in the mood to enjoy classic lectures from famous physicists[^1], look no further than Sidney Coleman's [**Physics 253**](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/events/videos/Phys253) videos, graciously hosted by Harvard. These videos are a difficult watch—the tapes from which they are taken don't offer the best quality—but Coleman's humor and physical insight manage to sift through. The contents were typed up and [uploaded to the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5013).

- Delving a bit into Quantum Computing we have Mermin's [**Quantum Computer Science**](http://www.lassp.cornell.edu/mermin/qcomp/CS483.html). These notes also got picked up by Cambridge University Press and were published under the same name.

More later.
