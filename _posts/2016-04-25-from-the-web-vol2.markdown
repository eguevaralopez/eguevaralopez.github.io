Second round of freebies from the web, with a slight bias for *QFT* material as I keep studying the subject;

- I have to mention [Tong's *Lectures on Quantum Field Theory*](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft.html); the videos are terrible quality `wmv` files, but watchable. Those can be skipped though, the real treat are the lecture notes! They are essentially a walkthrough of chapters 1 through 4 of Peskin & Schroeder's *An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory*.

- A resource I consult from time to time—when I need more explaining than P&S/Zee can provide, so not too often—is  [Srednicki's *Quantum Field Theory*](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/qft.html). Its available as a pre-publication draft, it has since been picked up by Cambridge University Press.

- When in the mood to enjoy classic lectures from famous physicists, look no further than [Sidney Coleman's *Physics 253*](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/events/videos/Phys253) videos, graciously hosted by Harvard. These videos are a difficult watch—the tapes from which they are taken don't offer the best quality—but Coleman's humor and physical insight manage to sift through. The contents of these lectures were typed up and [uploaded to arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5013).

- Delving a bit into Quantum Computing we have [Mermin's *Quantum Computation lecture notes*](http://www.lassp.cornell.edu/mermin/qcomp/CS483.html). These also got picked up by Cambridge University Press and published under the title *Quantum Computer Science*.

- More resources from Harvard! A budding theorist should have a firm grasp on Group Theory, [Benedict Gross' *Math 122*](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/open-learning-initiative/abstract-algebra)—a course aimed at Math undergrads—should fill up any gaps before the mandatory Lie Algebra course taken by physicists.

More later!
