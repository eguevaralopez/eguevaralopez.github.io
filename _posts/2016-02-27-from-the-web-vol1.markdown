Because a grad student's money is better spent on food and drink, here is a compendium of useful and free resources I've gone through (or plan to go through, in some cases) as I work towards my M.Sc. in Physics.

[**The Feynman Lectures on Physics**](http://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/), need I say more? There are no words to describe just how *good* these lectures are, and its a very big deal that they are available online for everyone. My thesis advisor recommended I buy this set, along with Dirac's *Principles* and von Neumann's *Foundations*, with my first salary.

Keeping with the lectures by famous physicists, you can check out Susskind's [**Theoretical Minimum**](http://theoreticalminimum.com) series. These are sometimes a bit slow, but enriching and full of insight. In fact, Susskind forever changed the way I picture and think about *Hamilton's principle* when he drew an *n*-dimensional coordinate system and sketched the action.

Stone and Goldbart's [**Mathematics for Physics: A Guided Tour for Grad Students**](http://www.goldbart.gatech.edu/PG_MS_MfP.htm) is available as a pre-publication draft. I mean, its a good book if you don't already have a resource on mathematical methods. My recommendation would still be to get a *used* copy of Arfken and Weber---preferably 3rd edition because its the one [Wolfram MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/) uses as reference---and have *that* handy.

Carroll's [**Lecture Notes on General Relativity**](http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9712019) can be found in the arXiv. These notes graduated and became Carroll's general relativity textbook, **Spacetime and Geometry**. They are written in a style that I found very engaging, its weird to admit but I was *addicted* to these lecture notes. Fun fact: I had 2 courses with this book as recommended reference---its good!

Kardar's MIT course [**8.333 Statistical Mechanics I**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-333-statistical-mechanics-i-statistical-mechanics-of-particles-fall-2013/) is a pleasure to watch, and the lecture notes available there form the backbone of his **Statistical Mechanics of Particles** textbook. I found these when I needed them most: the lecturer for my course constantly reverted to dutch and used a book I didn't enjoy much. I was never fond of statistical mechanics, but I went on to watch [**8.334 Statistical Mechanics II**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-334-statistical-mechanics-ii-statistical-physics-of-fields-spring-2014/). The notes for 8.334 are also available and went on to become Kardar's **Statistical Mechanics of Fields** book.

I'm always on the lookout for quality stuff, so there will probably be other posts like this one in the future.
