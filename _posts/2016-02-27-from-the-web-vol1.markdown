Because a grad student's money is better spent on food and drink, here is a compendium of useful and free resources I've gone through (or plan to go through, in some cases) as I work towards my M.Sc. in Physics;

- [**The Feynman Lectures on Physics**](http://feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)---need I say more? There are no words to describe just how *good* these lectures are, and its a very big deal that they are available online for everyone. My thesis advisor recommended I buy this set, along with Dirac's *Principles of Quantum Mechanics* and von Neumann's *Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics*, with my first Ph.D. salary (if I decide to go for one, that is). 

- Keeping with the lectures by famous physicists, you can check out Susskind's [**Theoretical Minimum**](http://theoreticalminimum.com) series. These are sometimes a bit slow, but enriching and full of little insight. In fact, Susskind forever changed the way I picture and think about *Hamilton's principle* when he drew an *n*-dimensional coordinate system and sketched the action.

- Stone and Goldbart's [**Mathematics for Physics: A Guided Tour for Grad Students**](http://www.goldbart.gatech.edu/PG_MS_MfP.htm) is available as a pre-publication draft. I mean, its an *okay* book if you need a resource on mathematical methods---especially a `pdf` to annotate digitally, if you're into that. My recommendation would be to get a *used* copy of Arfken and Weber[^1] and have it on the bookshelf.

- Carroll's [**Lecture Notes on General Relativity**](http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9712019) can be found in the arXiv. These notes graduated and became Carroll's general relativity textbook, **Spacetime and Geometry**. They are written in a style that I found very engaging, its weird to admit but I was *addicted* to these lecture notes. Fun fact: I had 2 courses with this book as recommended referenceâ€”its good!

- Kardar's MIT course [**8.333 Statistical Mechanics I**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-333-statistical-mechanics-i-statistical-mechanics-of-particles-fall-2013/) is a pleasure to watch, and the lecture notes available there form the backbone of his Statistical Mechanics textbook. I found these when I needed them most: the lecturer for my course constantly reverted to dutch and used a book I didn't enjoy much. I was never fond of Statistical Mechanics, but I went on to watch [**8.334 Statistical Mechanics II**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-334-statistical-mechanics-ii-statistical-physics-of-fields-spring-2014/) which is also available, along with its lecture notes.

I'm always on the lookout for quality stuff, so there will probably be other posts like this one in the future.
