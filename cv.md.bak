### Education
- **Master of Science in Physics**  
*Rijksuniversiteit Groningen* (University of Groningen)  
Groningen, Netherlands, 2018  

My thesis was titled [*Feynman's Path Integral Formalism in Spherical Coordinates: the Hydrogen Atom*](http://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/id/eprint/15766). It concerned itself with a review of the mathematics involved in the path-integral formalism, as well as the historically proposed solutions for the hydrogen atom using said formalism.

In particular, the solutions by *Duru and Kleinert* and by *Peak and Inomata* were studied in detail, reconstructed, and rewritten using simplified mathematics. The aim was to make these beautiful arguments understandable by undergrads.

- **Bachelor of Science in Physics**  
*Universidad de Costa Rica* (University of Costa Rica)  
San José, Costa Rica, 2012  

- **[*in-progress*] Licenciate in Electronics Engineering**  
*Tecnológico de Costa Rica* (Costa Rica's Institute of Technology)  
Expected 2023  

Electronics has been a recurrent hobby throughout my life, during the start of the covid-19 pandemic I decided to re-enroll as a student and get a degree in engineering.  

### Technical Skills
- I've been using *Linux* for 15+ years, I have working proficiency with *Debian* (and derivatives) and *openSUSE*.  
- I'm fairly experienced with scripting languages—*Bash* and *Python* in particular.  
I use Bash for day-to-day tasks or small tasks that need automating. I don't have expert knowledge of *sed* or *awk*, but I know where the *man-pages* are if I need help.  
Python I use mainly for simulations of physical systems: plotting probability distributions, looking into quantum tunneling, etc. I use libraries such as *numpy* and *scipy*, *matplotlib*, *jupyter* and *pandas*.  
- I have some experience with other languages, mostly *C* and *C++*; and with source-control via *Git*.
- To generate documents I use mainly $$\LaTeX$$ or *Markdown*; to process large data sets I use *python* and *pandas*. If need be, I am fairly proficient with *MS Office* and similar productivity packages.
- I have extensive instrumentation experience, including oscilloscopes, multimeters, logic analyzers, spectrum analyzers, and signal generators.  
- I also have extensive soldering experience, be it through-hole or surface-mount components.

### Other Skills
- Languages: *Spanish* (native), *English* (bilingual), *French* (intermediate), and *Dutch* (beginner).
