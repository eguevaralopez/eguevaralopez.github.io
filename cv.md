## Motivation

The last couple of years have been rough for everyone. We tried to make the best of our time at home by finding new hobbies or, as was my case, by rekindling our passion for old ones. I've had a life–long obsession with electronics, and decided to enroll back in school to pursue a degree in engineering.

After working many odd jobs through the years, my hope is to make a career in electronics. I am particularly interested in IC design and am currently doing my best to dive head-first into the subject.

## Education

- **Master of Science in Physics**  
*Rijksuniversiteit Groningen* (University of Groningen)  
Groningen, Netherlands, 2018  

My thesis was titled [*Feynman's Path Integral Formalism in Spherical Coordinates: the Hydrogen Atom*](http://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/id/eprint/15766). It concerned itself with a review of the mathematics involved in Feynman's formalism, as well as the historically proposed solutions for the hydrogen atom using said formalism.

In particular, the solutions by *Duru and Kleinert* and by *Peak and Inomata* were studied in detail, reconstructed, and rewritten using simplified mathematics. The aim was to make these beautiful arguments understandable by undergrads.

- **Bachelor of Science in Physics**  
*Universidad de Costa Rica* (University of Costa Rica)  
San José, Costa Rica, 2012  

A degree in logical problem-solving and analyzing data in the context of Physics. The methods, however, are universal.

## Experience

- **SOC Design Engineer**  
*Intel Corporation*  
2022 - present

## Technical Skills

- I have experience with various<!--[experience with various](https://www.codewars.com/users/eguevaralopez) --> programming languages like *C*, *C++*, *Python*, and *Bash*; and with source control via [*Git*](https://github.com/eguevaralopez).  
<!-- I'm fairly experienced with scripting languages—*Bash* and *Python* in particular.  -->
---I use *Bash* for day-to-day tasks or small tasks that need automating. I don't have expert knowledge of *sed* or *awk*, but I know where the *man-pages* are if I need help.  
---*Python* I've used mainly for simulations of physical systems: plotting probability distributions, looking into quantum tunneling, etc. I use libraries such as *numpy* and *scipy*, *matplotlib*, *jupyter*, and *pandas*.  
---The main use I have for *C* and *C++* is programming microcontrollers, which I have used in a myriad of hobby projects. Most recently I've been using MCUs to add functionality to old videogame consoles and to design custom controllers, for example.
<!-- I have some experience with other languages, mostly *C* and *C++*; and with source-control via *Git*.-->
- *HDL* experience via *Verilog* and *SystemVerilog*.  
- I have extensive instrumentation experience, including oscilloscopes, multimeters, logic analyzers, spectrum analyzers, and signal generators.  
- I also have extensive soldering experience, be it through-hole or surface-mount components.  
- I've been using *Linux* for 15+ years and have working proficiency with *Debian* (and derivatives) and *openSUSE*.
- To generate documents I use $$\LaTeX$$ or *Markdown*; to process large data sets I use *python* and *pandas*. If need be, I am fairly proficient with *MS Office* and similar productivity packages.  
- *Spanish* (native), *English* (bilingual), *French* (intermediate), and *Dutch* (beginner).

## Soft Skills

Working in the service industry—and in other non-standard jobs—has allowed me to accrue invaluable skills, among which stand out

- Clear and concise communication,
- Teamwork, leadership, and motivational skills,
- Conflict management, team building,
- Ability to address crowds,
- Adaptability and creativity.

## Other interests and hobbies

- Assembling and benchmarking old computers, for preservation purposes,
- Quantum computing and its hardware implementations,
- Running.
