## Education
- **Master of Science in Physics**  
*Rijksuniversiteit Groningen* (University of Groningen)  
Groningen, Netherlands, 2018  

My thesis was titled [*Feynman's Path Integral Formalism in Spherical Coordinates: the Hydrogen Atom*](http://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/id/eprint/15766). It concerned itself with a review of the mathematics involved in Feynman's formalism, as well as the historically proposed solutions for the hydrogen atom using said formalism.

In particular, the solutions by *Duru and Kleinert* and by *Peak and Inomata* were studied in detail, reconstructed, and rewritten using simplified mathematics. The aim was to make these beautiful arguments understandable by undergrads.

- **Bachelor of Science in Physics**  
*Universidad de Costa Rica* (University of Costa Rica)  
San José, Costa Rica, 2012  

A degree in logical problem-solving and analyzing data.

- **[*in progress*] Licentiate in Electronics Engineering**  
*Tecnológico de Costa Rica* (Costa Rica's Institute of Technology)  
Expected 2023  

Electronics has been a recurrent hobby throughout my life, during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic I decided to re-enroll as a student and get a degree in engineering.  

## Technical Skills
- I have [experience with various](https://www.codewars.com/users/eguevaralopez) programming languages like *C*, *C++*, *Python*, and *Bash*; and with source control via [*Git*](https://github.com/eguevaralopez).  
<!-- I'm fairly experienced with scripting languages—*Bash* and *Python* in particular.  -->
---I use *Bash* for day-to-day tasks or small tasks that need automating. I don't have expert knowledge of *sed* or *awk*, but I know where the *man-pages* are if I need help.  
---*Python* I use mainly for simulations of physical systems: plotting probability distributions, looking into quantum tunneling, etc. I use libraries such as *numpy* and *scipy*, *matplotlib*, *jupyter*, and *pandas*.  
---The main use I have for *C* and *C++* is programming microcontrollers, which I have used in a myriad of projects.
<!-- I have some experience with other languages, mostly *C* and *C++*; and with source-control via *Git*.-->
- *HDL* experience via *Verilog* and *SystemVerilog*.  
- I have extensive instrumentation experience, including oscilloscopes, multimeters, logic analyzers, spectrum analyzers, and signal generators.  
- I also have extensive soldering experience, be it through-hole or surface-mount components.  
- I've been using *Linux* for 15+ years and have working proficiency with *Debian* (and derivatives) and *openSUSE*.
- To generate documents I use $$\LaTeX$$ or *Markdown*; to process large data sets I use *python* and *pandas*. If need be, I am fairly proficient with *MS Office* and similar productivity packages.  
- *Spanish* (native), *English* (bilingual), *French* (intermediate), and *Dutch* (beginner).
